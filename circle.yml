# you can control the number of CI workers executing these commands
# using parallelism setting
# https://circleci.com/gh/cypress-io/cypress-example-group/edit#parallel-builds
# all CI workers will execute the same tasks, duplicating the work
# but their results should all go under the same run record on dashboard

    # record against staging environment
    - CYPRESS_ENV=staging CYPRESS_PROJECT_ID=$STAGING_PROJECT_ID CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY=$STAGING_RECORD_KEY npm run cy:run -- --record --group --group-id $CIRCLE_BUILD_NUM
    # record against staging environment with same id but use different browser
    # disable video recording because cannot record non-Electron browser
